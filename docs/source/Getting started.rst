   from pyNAVIS import *

With that, you will be able to use all the provided functionalities, which are specified in the :doc:`pyNAVIS package section <Installing>`.


Either if you installed the developer version of if you, as an user, want to get introduced with a set of code examples, 
you can find them in the ``/src/examples`` folder of the `Github repository <https://github.com/jpdominguez/pyNAVIS>`_

In ``/src/`` you will find a ``main.py`` file that can be used to run those examples.
