Installing
===============

This section describes how to install and set up ``pyNAVIS``.

First, some requirements need to be installed. If you already have a running Python 3 environment, you can skip this step and move either to the `User Installation <https://pynavis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing/user_installation.html>`__ or to the `Developer Installation <https://pynavis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing/dev_installation.html>`__.
